<h1>Summary</h1><br>

<p>
This project is a landing page for an insurance company. I used HTML, CSS and JavaScript to build this page but as an added challenge,
I wanted to work with a CSS pre-processor (SASS) and jQuery so that I could work with them more. I did really enjoy this project.<br>
Moving forward I see how some of the code that I wrote can be refactored and tweaked for readability. I worked to make the website as accessible as 
possible with in the design itself by using contrasting colors and adding "alt" tags to each photo that was used on the page. 
When it comes to SEO, I did find myself using the "div" element a little too much but started to look into other elements such as "container", "section"
and "article". I will continue this going forward.

<h2>Timeline</h2><br>
<p>
Project took about 2 1/2 days of coding for a few hours per day.<br>
A major hang up was working with SASS for the first time, and learning the most efficient workflow and folder structure.<br> 

note: I did hand code the hamburger menu in the mobile version of the site and will work to make it animate with keyframes.
